# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
The difference is that an `instance` calls on the `class` method to be called on itself. For example, it would be `<instance created>.methodClass()`

# Teacher Feedback

Your first sentence is unclear, but your example is correct. We call instance methods on instances that need to first be created, after creation then we can invoke those instance methods. Class methods can be called on the class directly!
