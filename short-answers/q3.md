# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(species, origin, likeOrNah){
    this.species = species;
    this.origin = origin;
    this.likeOrNah = likeOrNah;
    this.animals = [];
  }

  addExistingAnimal(animal) {
    this.animals.push(animal);
    console.log(`Existing animal, ${this.species}, is added! :)`);
  }

  addExtinctAnimal(animal) {
    this.animals.push(animal);
    console.log(`Extinct animal, ${this.species}, is added! :'(`);
  }
}

class ExtinctAnimal extends Animal {
  constructor(species, origin, likeOrNah, when) {
    super(species, origin, likeOrNah);
    this.when = when;
  }

  addExtinctAnimal(animal) {
    super.addExtinctAnimal(animal)
    console.log(`But maybe the ${animal} will come back someday!`);
  }
}
```

Great job! One small nitpick, make sure that you are creating an instance and invoking the method to make it super clear where the polymorphism is occurring!
